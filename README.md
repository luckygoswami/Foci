### üèõÔ∏è Architectural Philosophy

- **Feature-Sliced Design:** The `src/features` directory organizes code by business domain, making it easy to locate related components, hooks, and services. This keeps the codebase modular and scalable.
- **Component-Driven UI:** A strong emphasis on reusable and composable components, located in `src/components`. We use skeletons for loading states to ensure a smooth user experience.
- **Type Safety:** TypeScript is used throughout the project to catch errors early and improve code quality and maintainability.
- **Centralized Configuration:** Firebase and other configurations are kept in the `src/lib` directory for easy management.

## üèÅ Getting Started

Ready to jump in? Follow these steps to get the development environment up and running.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- A [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) project.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/luckygoswami/foci.git
    cd foci
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Firebase:**

    - Create a new project on the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    - Create a new Web App in your Firebase project.
    - Copy the Firebase configuration object.
    - Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and paste your config there:

    ```env
    # .env.local

    VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY="your-api-key"
    VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="your-auth-domain"
    VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
    VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="your-storage-bucket"
    VITE_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL="your-database-url"
    VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="your-messaging-sender-id"
    VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID="your-app-id"
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

The app should now be running on `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is busy).

### Available Scripts

- `pnpm dev`: Starts the development server with hot-reloading.
- `pnpm build`: Bundles the app for production.
- `pnpm preview`: Serves the production build locally.
- `pnpm lint`: Lints the codebase using ESLint.
