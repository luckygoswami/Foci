### üèõÔ∏è Architectural Philosophy

- **Feature-Sliced Design:** The `src/features` directory organizes code by business domain, making it easy to locate related components, hooks, and services. This keeps the codebase modular and scalable.
- **Component-Driven UI:** A strong emphasis on reusable and composable components, located in `src/components`. We use skeletons for loading states to ensure a smooth user experience.
- **Type Safety:** TypeScript is used throughout the project to catch errors early and improve code quality and maintainability.
- **Centralized Configuration:** Firebase and other configurations are kept in the `src/lib` directory for easy management.

## üèÅ Getting Started

Ready to jump in? Follow these steps to get the development environment up and running.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) (recommended) or npm
- A [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) project.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/luckygoswami/foci.git
    cd foci
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Firebase:**

    You have two distinct workflows for local development.

    #### Option 1: Using a Real Firebase Project

    - Create a new project on the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    - Create a new Web App in your Firebase project.
    - Copy the Firebase configuration object.
    - Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and paste your config there:

    ```env
    # .env

    VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY="your-api-key"
    VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="your-auth-domain"
    VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
    VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="your-storage-bucket"
    VITE_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL="your-database-url"
    VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="your-messaging-sender-id"
    VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID="your-app-id"
    ```

    #### Option 2: Using the Firebase Emulator Suite (Recommended)

    - No `.env` file or Firebase project is required for this option. All services run locally.
    - The `dev.js` script will automatically create a mock configuration and handle all emulator setup.

### Available Scripts

- `pnpm dev`:
  - **Runs the development server without emulators.** It connects to your real Firebase project using the configurations from your `.env` file.
  - This command will throw an error if the `.env` file is missing or incomplete.
- `pnpm dev --emulators`:
  - **Runs the development server with the Firebase Emulator Suite.** This is the recommended local development workflow as it requires no internet connection and no real Firebase project.
  - It automatically starts the following emulators: Auth, Firestore, Realtime Database, and App Hosting.
  - The emulator host is set to your machine's local IPv4 address, allowing other devices on your network to connect.
- `pnpm dev --emulators --import <path>`:
  - Starts the emulators and imports data from the specified local path. This is ideal for testing with pre-existing data.
  - Saves the emulator data to the `<path>` directory on exiting emulator.
- `pnpm build`: Bundles the app for production.
- `pnpm preview`: Serves the production build locally.
- `pnpm lint`: Lints the codebase using ESLint.
